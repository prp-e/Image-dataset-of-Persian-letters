# Image data of Persian fonts

PNG images with a size of 512 x 512 pixels are placed for each one Persian letter in the form of a collection of Persian alphabet letters from the list of fonts at the end of the page.

For each letter in an image font as below and its equivalent caption file with such content:
```
 arabic letter lam, B Baran Outline typeface
```

<p align="Sample image">
    <img src="./output/Vazir/beh_Vazir.png" alt="Sample image" width="600" height="auto">
</p>

is placed
In total,``` 6272 images ```with the corresponding caption file are categorized according to the font name in this database. The main ttf file of most of the fonts is in the font and script directory to create images of the Persian ttf font in the root of the project.

To improve the database, you can run the script with other fonts and request money :) Any help from you will make me happy, even giving a simple star.
